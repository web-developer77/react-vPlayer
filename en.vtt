00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480


00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.050
Think about a
difficult conversation

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.480
you've been avoiding.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.600
It might be with your boss.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.237
It might be with an
employee, or a coworker.

00:00:12.237 --> 00:00:14.320
You might be waking up in
the middle of the night,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.210
thinking about this conversation
that you would like to have

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.110
but aren't having.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.180
Nobody really likes conflict.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.420
The tendency is to put walls up.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.830
And the walls usually are
around judgment and fear.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.270
I want to keep you away, and
I want to keep myself safe.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.200
We are always giving
and receiving energy,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.730
as human beings.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.340
In a difficult conversation,
that energy gets stuck.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.750
It gets stopped, because
I want you to hear me,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.180
and you want me to hear you.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.330
And nobody's listening.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.650
This back and forth,
giving and receiving,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.720
energy is where Aikido comes in.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.260
Aikido.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.045
It means the way of blending,
or harmonizing, with energy.

00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:02.700


00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.319
If you watch Aikido
closely, you'll

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.580
see that it's not
really fighting.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.260
Our goal is to render the attack
harmless, without harming;

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.530
to manage to keep
ourselves safe,

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.640
but also to actually
protect the attacker.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.300


00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.050
We all practice verbal Aikido.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.600
In life, we use our emotions
to either attack people--

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.160
to sort of become really
passive and limp--

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.290
or we can use that
power, that energy,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.355
that emotion, our words,
our language to connect,

00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:39.360
and to find out, and to learn.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.110
When I'm in a
difficult conversation,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.680
I want to be purposeful,
and conscious,

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.210
and present with
you, and with myself.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.190
So that I don't have
any regrets later,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.070
that I was out of
control, or unconscious,

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.525
or said something that
was not purposeful.

00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:56.410


00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.180
Conflict doesn't have
to be a negative thing.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.890
It can be an opportunity.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.890
It can be a teacher.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.730
Conflict is the way that
we get to know each other,

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.930
that we get to know ourselves.
